# My GA Journey

You have decided to pen down your amazing journey with GA, from the start to graduation. There's just one problem - your diary is not exactly the nicest looking at this point!

*Don't worry, you're going to fix this.*

The contents for the diary are provided for you in `index.html`. Your goal is to fix the CSS in `styles.css` with **flexbox** and **media queries** to make the page nice and responsive.

The end results should look like these (or as close as possible): [gallery](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

# Deliverables
### 1. The main view for laptop:
- All 3 posts are aligned in 3 columns on the same row.

### 2. The responsive view for tablet (eg. breakpoint at 1024px)
- All posts are aligned in 1 column.
- The latest post should be displayed on the top.
- The first and second posts are divided into 2 sub-columns on the second row.

### 3. Mobile (eg. breakpoint at 667px)
- All posts are aligned in 1 column.
- The latest post should be displayed on the top.
- The second post should be displayed in the middle.
- the first post should be displayed at the bottom.

*HINT: Most CSS are done with the help of extensive googling.*
